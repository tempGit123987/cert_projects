            Can you read that above text? Because I sure can't, but it does in fact say something. That language is known as binary, and it is what all computers use to think in. Well "think in" we don't have true full sentient AI yet...yet. But regardless that is the language computers operate in.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fortunately we as programmers don't actually have to know how to speak binary, because programming languages have come a loooong way. In fact most programming languges just look like you're writing a funny note section with a bunch of abbreviations. So let's get started! Oh and in case you were wondering, the computer is saying hello.

            There are a LOT of programming languages, some of them are just an offshoot of a different language, others are something completely new. Here are a few that are important for one reason or another.

          Ah, good ol C++, nothing beats that (ironically that reference is probably dated to people that don't have fond memories of C++ but oh well).
        </p>
        <p>
          C++ is the starting point for a lot of programmers, and for good reason, it has just the right amount of readability, but also technical strength, here let me show you.

          <h3>Hello world</h3>
        </header>
        <article>
        <p>The classic hello world, basically the first thing anyone ever learns to write in any language. You might not know it now, but you'll feel real nosalgic for this one day, trust me. Anyway to write it in C++ you would simply type this:
        <p>
        <code> cout << "Hello World"</code>
        <p>That's it! ...well sort of. There is more to it than that, but one step at a time. "cout" stands for "console out" and it means somethign being output to the console, pretty simple huh? Don't worry, this is literally only the tip of the iceburg.

          <h3>Variables</h3>
        </header>
          <article>
            <p> So now you know how to output some text, waht if we want to input something? I'll get into how to actually get input in a second, but first I wanna talk about variables. First some examples:
            </p>
            <code>int</code>
            <code>float</code>
            <code>char</code>
            <code>string</code>
            <p>I know those probably don't make a lot of sense by themselves but they are some of the foundational ways to get input in C++. 'int' is short for "integer" and would accept a whole number, like 1, 2, or -50, it has an upper and lower bounds...(continued on un-created next page)
